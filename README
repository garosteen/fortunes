This is a custom fortunes directory.

The template for the makefile was borrowed but modified from:
http://bradthemad.org/tech/notes/fortune_makefile.php

To create fortunes, simply write them in text files, separated by %.
Run 'make' every time you update a file.
Feel free to add or delete files.
Every fortune file comes with a .dat file.
