Therefore the sages:
Manage the work of detached actions,
Conduct the teaching of no words.
They work with myriad things, but do not control.
They create, but do not possess.
They act, but do not presume.
They succeed, but do not dwell on success.
It is because they do not dwell on success
That it never goes away.
    -- Tao Te Ching, II

Act without contrivance
And nothing will be beyond control.

Heaven and Earth are without bias
And regard the myriad things as straw dogs.
The sage is without bias
And regards people as straw dogs.
